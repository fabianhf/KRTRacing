% controller for the single-track model
%
% inputs: x (x position), y (y position), v (velocity), beta
% (side slip angle), psi (yaw angle), omega (yaw rate), x_dot (longitudinal
% velocity), y_dot (lateral velocity), psi_dot (yaw rate (redundant)), 
% varphi_dot (wheel rotary frequency)
%
% external inputs (from 'racetrack.mat'): t_r_x (x coordinate of right 
% racetrack boundary), t_r_y (y coordinate of right racetrack boundary),
% t_l_x (x coordinate of left racetrack boundary), t_l_y (y coordinate of
% left racetrack boundary)
%
% outputs: delta (steering angle ), G (gear 1 ... 5), F_b (braking
% force), zeta (braking force distribution), phi (gas pedal position)
