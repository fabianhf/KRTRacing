In order to use Snopt, please place all
Snopt binaries, m-files, mex-files, and related
code in the folder 

\vendor\snopt\SNOPT

that you must create. This folder should can contain all files
that were distributed to you by Snopt.

The provided function handles in the folder
\vendor\snopt\
will automatically make the correct call to the Snopt class
in the solver folder.
So do NOT change them.

Within FALCON.m, you can call Snopt similar to Ipopt by using:
solver = falcon.solver.snopt(problem);

FALCON.m will automatically add Snopt to your path, if you do
not want to do it by hand.
