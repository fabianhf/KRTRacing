function states = states()
    % The states for the models and constraints. It should be a column vector of falcon.State
    % objects. You can specify lower and upper bounds, and if necessary tune scaling and
    % offset to improve numerical performance manually. You may omit scaling and offset.

    states = [{%for state in states %}
        falcon.State('{{ state }}', -inf, +inf, 1, 0);{% end %}
    ];
end
