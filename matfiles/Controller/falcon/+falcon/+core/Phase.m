        % time and the given controls, adds it to the list of control grids of this
        % phase and returns it. If no normalized time is specified the
        % state-grid discretization is used.
        %  
        % <Inputs>
        % > controls: A vector of falcon.Control objects defining the controls to be used
        % on this control grid.
        % > normalizedTime: The points in normalized time where the control
        % values are defined. If no normalized time is specified the
        % state-grid discretization is used.
        %  
        % <Outputs>
        % > controlGrid: Control-grid object.
